"""## Challenge 6-2-3

Create a streamlit with the fast food dataset. 

`fast_food_nutrition_cleaned.csv` 

Let' input the macro nutrient: protein, fat, carbs, and sugar as a dropdown.

Create a heatmap of the calories vs. the macro nutrient broken down by the type fast food restaurant.

You'll have to pivot the data to create the heatmap. So use a mean aggregation to create the heatmap... average carbs, etc...

How can you interpret the heatmap you see?"""
